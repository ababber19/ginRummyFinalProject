# ginRummyFinalProject
Final project for intro to programming 

This will be a pair-programming project. This means you will pick a partner (or a group of 3 if there are an odd number in the class). We will be discussing what pair-programming means but below are the rules, restated:

Rules for Pair Promgramming:

Share: When two programmers are tasked with creating one piece of code they must
share the responsibility. One person should be typing (driving) and the other should be reviewing and telling the driver where to go next (navigating). The person that is typing should not be thinking up the code on his/her own.
• Play Fair: It is important that each member of the group have equal time driving and equal time navigating.
• Clean-Up: Defects belong to the pair. That means if a mistake is made, regardless of who was typing or navigating, it should be fixed immediately.
• Stay Together: All programming must be done together. Do not create pieces of code alone. Two heads are better than one.
• Say You’re Sorry: Do not insist on having things your way; working with another person means there must be compromise. Don’t get defensive about criticism – it is a learning tool. Work things out together

Each pair will turn in one programming project (which will consist of multiple python files). Each person will turn in documentation, which will be described further later.
In this lab you will be creating a game of your choice! The restrictions are only that your game must use objects, the details of which are to follow. You can choose whether or not to have a visual component as well (using Graphics.py); but some games will require a visual component
